                    Are both perhaps present in time future<br>
                    And time future contained in time past.<br>

                    For a further union, a deeper communion<br>
                    Through the dark cold and empty desolation,<br>
                    The wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters<br>
                    Of the petrel and the porpoise. In my end is my beginning.<br>

                The awful daring of a moment’s surrender<br>
                Which an age of prudence can never retract<br>
                By this, and this only, we have existed<br>

                Why should I blame her that she filled my days<br> 
                With misery, or that she would of late<br>
                Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,<br>
                Or hurled the little streets upon the great,<br>

                The art of losing isn’t hard to master;<br>
                so many things seem filled with the intent<br>
                to be lost that their loss is no disaster.<br>
