# Making an API Call

## Steps
1. Attempt to authenticate through Postman or cURL
2. Save both request and response to a document
	* Full JSON examinable in static doc, not just a Postman request
3. Get in-page JS to send requests successfully 
	* `console.log()` full API response to a pre-baked request
	* depending on depth, this request may be incomplete
4. Add in-page JS for dynamic response
5. Build HTML based on that response
